<h5 class="uppercase"> A real man is a man with genuine self-confidence and true masculinity. He's a man who knows his own mind and knows what he's about in life, and he's not afraid to stand up for what he believes in. ... A real man has the strength of character to be his own man in the world and to always be true to himself.</h5>
